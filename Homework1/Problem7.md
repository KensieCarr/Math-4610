## Problem 7
**Routine Name:**           Find Roots of A Quadratic Polynomial

**Author:** Kensie Carr

**Language:** C++

**Description/Purpose:** 
This routine will take a quadratic polynomial $ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $ and find the existing solutions.

**Input:** 
The inputs are the coefficients of the polynomial $a,b,c$ .

**Output:** 
The outputs are the solutions to the quadratic polynomial, otherwise known as the roots. The solutions will be output as an array.

**Usage/Example:**
Say for example you had the quadratic polynomial 
<p>
  $$6x^2 - 7x - 3 = 0 $$  
</p>
you can use the quadratic formula to find the roots
<p>
 $ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\
   x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(6)(-3)}[2(6)} \\
   x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 72}}{12} \\
   x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{12} \\
   x = \frac{7 \pm 11}{12} \\
   x = \frac{7 + 11}{12},\ \ \ \ \ x = \frac{7 - 11}{12} \\
   x = \frac{18}{12},\ \ \ \ \ x = \frac{-4}{12} \\
   x = \frac{3}{2},\ \ \ \ \ x = \frac{-1}{3}$
</p>
therefore the roots of the polynomial are
<p>
  $$ \frac{3}{2} \text{ and } \frac{-1}{3} $$
</p>
