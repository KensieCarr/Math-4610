## Problem 1a

**Routine Name:**           Compute Absolute Error

**Author:** Kensie Carr

**Language:** C++

**Description/Purpose:** 
This routine computes the absolute error in the approximation of one number by another.

**Input:**
z = single value solution
y = numerical method produced solution

**Output:** 
E = Absolute Error

**Usage/Example:**
Suppose that z = 2.2, while some computed solution y = 2.20345. The absolute error can be computed using |E| = |y - z|. In this case the absolute error is 0.00345 or 3.45 x 10^{-3}

**Implementation/Code:** 
```c++
int absoluteError (int solution, int computedSolution) { 
    int absoluteError = abs(computedSolution - solution);
    return absoluteError;
}
```
