## Problem 2


**Routine Name:**           Approximation of Derivatives

**Author:** Kensie Carr

**Language:** C++

**Description/Purpose:** 
Due to finite precision of arithmetic problems can occur when approximating. In particular, one standard approximation for derivatives involves the definition
<p> 
    $f'(x)dx = \displaystyle \lim_{h \rightarrow} \dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$
</p>
The approximation for this is
<p> 
    $f'(x)dx \approx \dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} $
</p>
This routine gives an approximation for functions and compares relative and absolute error to investigate this approximation as *h* tends to zero. 


**Input:**
Some function
